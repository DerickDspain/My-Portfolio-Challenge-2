      <article class="about">
        <p>
          My name is Derick Dspain, I currently reside in a rural south Texas
          town called Uvalde. I was raised on a cattle ranch learning the trade
          of a cattleman along the way. Growing up on a ranch has provided me
          with the mindset that I apply today in my pursuit of knowledge in
          coding. Whether it be solving complex problems and innovating new ways
          to solve them, or managing my time to complete a project on time and
          correctly meeting the criteria needed. Outside of work I enjoy
          anything pertaining to the outdoors, I enjoy online PC games with
          friends, most physical sports, and I am an avid hunter and fisherman
          as well. In the future I hope to apply my knowledge and ideas to help
          the agricultural industry grow and achieve new heights. My goals in
          life are fueled by my family, my desire to learn new and interesting
          things, a good challenge, and just the overall knowledge and
          experience that one needs in life.
