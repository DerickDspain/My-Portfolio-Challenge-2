        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Derick Dspain, I currently reside in a rural south Texas town called Uvalde. I was raised on a cattle ranch learning the trade of a cattleman along the way.
        Growing up on a ranch has provided me with the mindset that I apply today in my pursuit of knowledge in coding. Whether it be solving complex problems and innovating new ways to solve them, 
        or managing my time to complete a project on time and correctly meeting the criteria needed. Outside of work I enjoy anything pertaining to the outdoors, I enjoy online PC games with friends,
        most physical sports, and I am an avid hunter and fisherman as well. In the future I hope to apply my knowledge and ideas to help the agricultural industry grow and achieve new heights.
