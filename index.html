      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          My name is Derick Dspain, I currently reside in a rural south Texas
          town called Uvalde. I was raised on a cattle ranch learning the trade
          of a cattleman along the way. Growing up on a ranch has provided me
          with the mindset that I apply today in my pursuit of knowledge in
          coding. Whether it be solving complex problems and innovating new ways
          to solve them, or managing my time to complete a project on time and
          correctly meeting the criteria needed. Outside of work I enjoy
          anything pertaining to the outdoors, I enjoy online PC games with
          friends, most physical sports, and I am an avid hunter and fisherman
          as well. In the future I hope to apply my knowledge and ideas to help
          the agricultural industry grow and achieve new heights.
